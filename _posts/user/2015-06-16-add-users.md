###What’s a User?
You guessed it. A User is a person with access to your Company in Rise Vision and you can create as many Users as you’d like!

###Add a User
Users are managed from your Account Settings. To access your Account Settings select your Username in the top right corner within Rise Vision. Afterwards select 
**Company Users** then **Add User**. Select **Company Users**, then select **Add User**. Fill out the information for the new user, and select their role(s). 
Select **Save**. Using this email address, your new user can now log in to your company on Rise Vision!
