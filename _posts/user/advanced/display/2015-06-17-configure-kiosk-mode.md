We support Chrome OS devices that are enrolled in [Google Device Management](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1289314?hl=en), this allows Chrome OS to automatically recover if the Chrome browser inadvertently shuts down. We recommend always remaining 1 or 2 major versions of Chrome OS behind to ensure your content is never adversely impacted by an update.
