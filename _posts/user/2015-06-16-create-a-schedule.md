###What’s a Schedule
A Schedule is what you use to control the Presentation(s) and/or HTML Pages that run on your Display. From your Schedule, you’ll specify a Distribution, which 
is a selection of one or more Displays you’ve created, and a list of Presentations and/or HTML Pages that will appear on those Displays.

###Add a Schedule
From Rise Vision select **Schedules** and then **Add** in the top right. Give your Schedule a name then edit the **Distribution** to specify which Displays to 
control. Next, specify which Presentation(s) or HTML Pages should appear by adding them to the Presentation/URL section. Select **Save** and the Displays 
defined in the Distribution begin showing your presentations. That’s it! You’re now all set up and displaying on your own digital signage!
