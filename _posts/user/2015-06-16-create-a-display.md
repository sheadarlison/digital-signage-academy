###What’s a Display
We use the term “Display” to refer to both the screen and computer (media player) that together show your content on your digital signage. The media player uses 
the Chrome browser and the Rise Player Chrome Application to receive and publish your content on your screen. 

###Add a Display
From Rise Vision select **Displays** and then **Add Display**. Give your Display a name and save it.
Once saved a *Display ID* is generated and you will use that ID to register the media player you install Rise Player on next.

###Install Rise Player on Chrome OS
Please consult our [Chrome OS Optimization Guide](user/advanced/display/configure-kiosk-mode) for more information about setting up Rise Player on Chrome OS.

###Install Rise Player on Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04, or Mac OS X
Confirm that your media player has the latest version of Chrome installed and if it doesn’t download it from [www.google.com/chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

Now install [Rise Player](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rise-vision-chrome-app-pl/mfpgpdablffhbfofnhlpgmokokbahooi) from the Chrome Web Store and 
then start it. When prompted enter the **Display ID** you created above.

To stop Rise Player enter the key combination *Control + W* on your keyboard.

Next select the operating system [Windows](user/advanced/display/chrome-player-windows), [Ubuntu](user/advanced/display/chrome-player-linux) or [Mac OS X](user/advanced/display/chrome-player-mac) you are using and optimize it for digital signage according to their respective guides.

Note that if you’re using a non-supported operating system you’ll need to make sure to disable any screen saver, display standby/sleep mode, as well as 
configuring the Rise Player App to start automatically after a reboot. Rise Player is a Chrome Application that can run anywhere Chrome runs but please take 
note we only support Ubuntu, Windows, Chrome OS and Mac OS X.
