###Sign Up
First, make sure you have a Google account. If you don’t already have one don’t worry. You can create one for free at https://accounts.google.com/signup. You can associate any email address with a Google Account, click on "I prefer to use my current email address" and then set your password.

From Rise Vision select **Sign Up Free** in the top right corner, then **Start with a Google Account** and enter your Google account credentials. Next, complete 
the preceding form (it’s just three fields!) select **Save** and that’s it - you now have a Rise Vision account!
