###What’s a Presentation?
A Presentation is the content, created in HTML, that is shown on your Display(s).

###Create a Presentation
If you’re just getting started in Rise Vision we recommend creating your first Presentation using one of our Templates. To do this, select **Presentations** and 
then select **Add from Template** in the top right corner. The Template Library will be presented. Select any Template you’d like. The Template you select will 
be added to your Company and the the Editor will be opened. Feel free to make any changes you want. It’s yours! 

Creating a blank Presentation is just as simple. From Rise Vision select **Presentations** and then select **Add** in the top right corner. Next, you’ll be 
presented with a blank Presentation in the Editor from which you can start building whatever you’d like.
