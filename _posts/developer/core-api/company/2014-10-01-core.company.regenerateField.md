The fields currently supported are: `authKey`, `alertKey`, `claimId`.

*This method requires OAuth2 authentication.*

*Logged in User must have __User Administrator__ role in order to perform this operation.*

####Parameters

| Name    | Type   | Required | Default Value | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:--------:|:--------------|:------------|
| **id**  | string |  **NO**  | Unique ID of the Company logged in User belongs to. | Unique ID of the Company. |
| **fieldName**  | string |  **YES**  | N/A | Field to be regenerated (`authKey`, `alertKey` or`claimId`). |
| **fields**  | string |  **NO**  | Empty | Comma-separated list of fields to include in a partial response. Empty value causes all fields to be included. |

####Output

If the User is authenticated successfully and `id` corresponds to an existing Company that logged in User has access to, the value of the field is regenerated and the new value is returned as `item`:

```200 OK```

```javascript
{
 "item": "u0Ds32duTtNx",
 "kind": "core#companyItem",
 "etag": "\"7XF7vTsSDvyCr9DK--Pnil6e4O8/Xb12HdTkDJylon6jvSVqCxACM38\""
}
```

If the User is not authenticated, the following response is returned:

```401 Unauthorized```

```javascript
{
 "error": {
  "errors": [
   {
    "domain": "global",
    "reason": "required",
    "message": "User is not authenticated",
    "locationType": "header",
    "location": "Authorization"
   }
  ],
  "code": 401,
  "message": "User is not authenticated"
 }
}
```

If `id` does not correspond to the logged in User's Company or a Company under the logged in User's Company, the following response is returned:

```403 Forbidden```

```javascript
{
 "error": {
  "errors": [
   {
    "domain": "global",
    "reason": "forbidden",
    "message": "User is not allowed access"
   }
  ],
  "code": 403,
  "message": "User is not allowed access"
 }
}
```

If the logged in User does not have the Role necessary to allow this operation, the following response is returned:

```403 Forbidden```

```javascript
{
 "error": {
  "errors": [
   {
    "domain": "global",
    "reason": "forbidden",
    "message": "User does not have the necessary rights"
   }
  ],
  "code": 403,
  "message": "User does not have the necessary rights"
 }
}
```

If any field other than `authKey`, `alertKey` or`claimId` is passed in `fieldName` parameter, the following response is returned (name of the field is included in the message):

```400 Bad Request```

```javascript
{
 "error": {
  "errors": [
   {
    "domain": "global",
    "reason": "badRequest",
    "message": "Field street cannot be regenerated using this function."
   }
  ],
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Field street cannot be regenerated using this function."
 }
}
```
