The Rise Vision Player is a Java application that loads the Display ID from a local file and starts the Chrome browser with the Viewer URL, which includes the Display ID as a parameter.
When the Viewer starts, it checks if a Display ID has been supplied and then either loads the Presentation or shows the Display Registration form.
This means that a new installation will always show the Display Registration form. If a user registers the Display via the form, after registration is complete the Viewer will tell the Player to save the Display ID locally.

Note: The Viewer will not call any Player API functions unless `player=true` is present in the Viewer URL.
