Gets a file.

To retrieve a file (all types), send the following GET request to localhost:

`http://localhost:9494/?url={url}`

or the following HEAD request to localhost:

`http://localhost:9494/?url={url}`

To retrieve a video file, send the following GET request to localhost:

`http://localhost:9494/video{.fileExtension}?url={url}`

or the following HEAD request to localhost:

`http://localhost:9494/video{.fileExtension}?url={url}`

####Parameters

| Name    | Required | Description |
|:--------|:--------:|:------------|
| **url**  |  **YES** | URL of the file to retrieve. |
| **fileExtension**  |  **NO** | File extension of the video. This helps Player libraries, such as JWPlayer, to recognize the type of the video. It does not affect the functionality of Rise Cache. |

####Output

When a file is requested from Rise Cache, one of the following occurs:

- Rise Cache returns the file if it has been downloaded and exists in the cache.
- Rise Cache puts the requesting call on hold and adds the requested file to the queue. The file is returned to the Viewer as soon as it has been downloaded. There is a one hour timeout interval for the hold.
- Rise Cache returns the same error that is returned by the file server if the requested file is unavailable.
