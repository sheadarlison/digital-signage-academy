Every item (Widget, image, video etc.) that can be added to a Placeholder, gets rendered inside of an `iframe` when the Presentation is previewed or run on a Display. You might find yourself needing to interact with that item from the Presentationâ€™s HTML. Luckily, there is a handy Javascript utility function you can use that makes this easier.

To retrieve all of the `iframe` IDs for a particular Placeholder, just call `getPlaceholderIFrameIds`, passing in the ID of the Placeholder as a parameter. For example, calling this function for a Placeholder named `ph0` would look like this:

```
getPlaceholderIFrameIds("ph0");
```

This will return an array containing the `iframe` IDs, the order of which corresponds to the order of the items in the Placeholder.

This function is especially helpful when the Presentation needs to call some code inside of a Widget itself, or to pause Widgets in multi-page Presentations when they are not visible, and start them again when they are.
