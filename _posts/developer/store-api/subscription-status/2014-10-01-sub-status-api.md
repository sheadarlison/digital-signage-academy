## Code sample for Calling the API

The easiest way to call the API is to use the JQuery Ajax function. This Javascript code sample will call the Authorization API, interpret the result, and set up a timer for refreshing the APIs status:

```
var url = "https://store-dot-rvaserver2.appspot.com/v1/company/" + companyId + "/product/status?pc=" + productCode;

$.ajax({
dataType: "json",
url: url,
success: function(data, textStatus) {
if (data && data[0]) {
// API was successful
// Product status is available via data[0].status
else {
// API failed, verify the request
}
},
error: function() {
// Server error
}
};
```

## Testing & debugging your implementation

Once the Store Authorization has been implemented (either via the component or custom code), it is adviseable that it is tested both on a Display and in a Presentation Preview, to ensure all scenarios work correctly.

Here are some of the things that may go wrong, with some possible solutions:

**Issue:** The Server responds that the Display Id/Company Id cannot be found.

**Solution:** Ensure the retrieval method for the Id is working correctly, triggering an `alert()` in the Javascript code with the specific Id will do the trick.


**Issue:** The Server responds that the Widget is not authorized despite the fact that it has been Purchased

**Solution:** Ensure that the Presentation and Display that are being used are from the same Company where the Widget has been Purchased.
