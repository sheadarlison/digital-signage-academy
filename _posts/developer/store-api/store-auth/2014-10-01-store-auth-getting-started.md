####Obtain a Product Code
If you will be selling a product that requires authorization from the Rise Vision Store, you will need to obtain a Product Code. A Product Code is a unique ID that is associated with your product when you register it in the Store. 

A Product Code is required to use the Store Authorization API.

To request a Product Code for your Application or Widget please complete the form here, http://www.risevision.com/store-api-request-form/.
