###Channel signals

The following signals can be sent by the Core to the Viewer over the Channel:

####Parameters

| Signal                        | Meaning                             |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| **updated** *request_ticket*  | Content has been updated, Viewer should request content update from the Core. Viewer should pass `request_ticket` in the request as a query parameter. |
| **ping**                      | The Core is sending this signal at regular intervals to all Viewers that are connected to the channel, if the Viewer does not receive it at expected time, it should assume that channel has disconnected and reconnect again. |
| **ayt**                       | The Core sends this signal one after it receives notification that the Viewer has disconnected. If the Viewer receives this signal it should assume that the Core cannot detect its connection to the channel and reconnect. |


**request_ticket** is a random sequence of 20 characters. It is used to avoid accidental blocking by the Core as the request it is passed with is exempted from the rate calculation the Core uses for blocking.
Request ticket is single use, passing it with subsequent requests has no effect.
