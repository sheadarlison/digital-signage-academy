Returns content for a Display.

To request content, send the following GET request **over SSL**:

`https://rvaserver2.appspot.com/v1/viewer/display/{displayId}?callback={callbackFunctionName}&sig={contentSignature}&ticket={requestTicket}&width={displayWidth}&height={displayHeight}`

####Parameters

| Name    | Required | Description |
|:--------|:--------:|:------------|
| **displayId**  |  **YES**  | Unique ID of the Display. |
| **callbackFunctionName**  |  **NO**  | Name of the JavaScript callback function to be used for JSONP response. If this value is omitted, JSON response is returned. |
| **contentSignature**  |  **NO**  | Digital signature of the content received with the content during the most recent content update. |
| **requestTicket**  |  **NO**  | [Request ticket]({{site.absoluteurl}}developer/viewer-api/notifications/signals) received from the channel. |
| **displayWidth**  |  **NO**  | Display width in pixels. |
| **displayHeight**  |  **NO**  | Display height in pixels. |


####Output

If Viewer has requested data before and none of the Viewer’s content entities (Schedule, Presentation) on the server have changed since the last update (as determined by the content signature):

*JSON:*

```javascript
{"status": {"code": 0, "message": "OK."},
 "content": null,
 "signature": null,
 "display": {"displayAddress": display_address},
 "company": {"authKey": authentication_key},
 "social":[{
    "network":network_name,
    "access": access_token,
    "location": location_token
  }, ... ],

`network_name` is the name of a social network.

`access_token` is the OAuth access token for the social network associated with the Display.

`location_token` is the location token for the social network associated with the Display.

`ping_interval` is the interval (in minutes) between ping signals]({{site.absoluteurl}}developer/viewer-api/notifications/signals) sent to the Viewer over the channel (default is 30).

`poll_interval` is the expected interval (in minutes) between polls from the Viewer (default is 30).

`block_remaining` is the number of minutes remaining until a block expires (if applicable) or 0 otherwise.



If Viewer has never requested data before (content signature was not provided) or one of the Viewer’s content entities (Schedule, Presentation) on the server have changed since the last update (as determined by the content signature):
